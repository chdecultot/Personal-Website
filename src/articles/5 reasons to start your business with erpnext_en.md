You are creating a startup or taking over an existing firm and need to think about the tools you are going to use to invoice your first client. And it is only a beginning.  
There are many choices on the market, from Quickbooks to SAGE or SAP. Some are specialized only in invoicing and accounting, others are full-fledged ERP systems most of the time not affordable and too complex for a small business.  

ERPNext is quite an exception to this state of affairs for a lot of reasons. Here are five of them.
</br>

#### #1. ERPNext is a powerful ERP  

Why choose an ERP straight when you start a new company ?
An ERP is the backbone of your operations. You can manage your invoices, accouting, inventory, human resources, projects or point of sales centrally and it all communicates together.  

You may not need all the functionalities from an ERP when starting your activity, but as soon as you will grow, you will constantly need to automate a lot of actions and will need the right tool for it.  

ERPNext includes all functionalities needed by small and medium businesses. No need to pay for an invoicing software, an accounting software or an HR software separately. And if you need more functionalities tomorrow, there is a great chance they are already present in ERPNext.  

As unreal as it may seems, you can have the same powerful tools as a big company for a fraction of their IT budget.

#### #2. ERPNext is simple, beautiful and functional

The main feature of ERPNext is its user interface.  
Business software have often outdated user interfaces and are complicated to use for people with a light technical background.  

With ERPNext, the experience is smooth for the user. Once he/she gets used to the way the software works, the experience will be similar in all modules. Like with any object, it is then up to you to like its design or not.  

Its iPhone and Android applications makes it also easy to enter or check data from any phone or tablet.  
This is modern and mostly efficient. A great user experience means less time spent searching how-to-do things, and more time getting things done.  
</br>

#### #3. ERPNext is a framework to adopt business best practices

You are starting a business and may have experience in one or several domains, but surely not all.  
You will also have difficulties setting up processes for all your operation activities from scratch and straight from the start.  

This is were adopting an ERP becomes very handy.  
All workflows are already following business best practices and are permanently refined by the community to be more efficient.  

Don't get me wrong, the point is not to blindly adopt all proposed workflows, but to start by using them without reinventing the wheel and improve them as you grow.

#### #4. ERPNext allows you to keep control over your data

You may think that you have nothing to hide or don't care about putting all your operations' data in the hand of a single vendor somewhere in the cloud.  

Since business data is central in the global competition, you may not want to take the risk of not having a complete control over where and how your data are stored.  

With ERPNext, you can either create your own cloud on your servers, choose to be hosted by the [Frappe Team](https://erpnext.com/signup?res=9847700900) in India or choose a third party agency like [DOKOS](https://www.dokos.io/erp) to handle the hosting for you. You are fully in control.

#### #5. ERPNext is overall cheaper than its competitor

When evaluating the cost of an ERP, take into account two main items: implementation and hosting (including maintenance and security).</br>  
Regarding the implementation costs, you can decide to do everything yourself or request help for a basic configuration at almost no cost.  
It is worth considering for small businesses who want to boostrap their activity and will configure the software according to their growing needs.  

If you need to migrate your data and configure the different modules in-depth before switching from your existing system to ERPNext, these implementation costs will be higher (up to a few thousand euros) and based on the time and skills necessary to fulfill your needs.  
In any case consider that these costs are similar to the cost of implementing and configuring a proprietary software (SaaS or On-premise).</br>
When it comes to maintenance and hosting costs, the open-source licence of ERPNext makes it cheaper than its competitors since your marginal price per application is significantly lower.  
Said differently, you may pay a similar price for a SaaS application, but very few offer as many functionalities as ERPNext, which means that you would need to suscribe to additional applications each time you need a new tool to run your business.  
And if you are implementing a proprietary ERP, the price is anyway way higher from the beginning for the same functionalities.
