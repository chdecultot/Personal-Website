If you are a startup, a small or medium size company, there are no more reasons to spend thousands and thousands in licences every year.  
Marc Andreessen noticed in 2011 that "software is eating the world", but I really agree with the assertion that open-source software is eating the software world in 2016.  
Investing in an open-source stack can help you work with the same tools as big companies but with much more flexibility... and save money at the same time.  

#### How is that even possible ?

Do you know that in 2015, 39% of software installed on enterprise PCs around the world were not properly licensed ? (source: [BSA](http://www.bsa.org/))  
Besides a risk of prosecution and huge penalties, the highest risk is a security risk since, still according to BSA, there is a strong correlation between malware and unlicensed software. 

So you may think that the solution would be to simply pay your licences and setting up a software management process.  
I agree, but unless you are a big company with a big IT budget and some people dedicated for it, it is surely not an option.  

Luckily, in the course of two decades, open-source software have become a real alternative to proprietary software. It may need some mindset change to be adopted, but there is an alternative to almost any major software your company may need.  
Most of the time you don't have to pay any licence fee, which doesn't mean that it is free, but it's better to pay for something tangible like customer support and maintenance (which you would have paid for a proprietary software anyway), or additional functionality you will actually use than intangible licences.  

Regarding security, I won't go into a debate, but there no evidence that open-source software are less secure than proprietary software. Open-source software are already running on almost any servers in the world, in a vast majority of phones and even in your car. All GAFA are embracing it and more and more countries are using them for their administration.  
The US Government has even released a new federal source code policy requiring governement agencies to release 20% of any code they create as open-source.  
Even Microsoft is integrating Ubuntu and Bash in its latest version of Windows 10. Some might say it's a little revolution given the [position of Microsoft](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/02/ballmer_linux_is_a_cancer/) regarding Linux fifteen years ago.  

Finally, a lot of big companies (Amazon, Cisco, Facebook, Microsoft,...) are also funding the [Core Infrastructure Initiative (CII)](https://www.coreinfrastructure.org/), a project started by the Linux Foudation in order to address security concerns, mostly regarding small under-funded projects.  

All these movements around open-source software are contributing to make it more secure than ever. It has therefore to be seriously considered for production purposes in any kind of companies.  

##### What are the impact of an open-source stack ?

The first and most critical impact would be: change.  

I mean that you are used to work with some software for years. You know how it looks like, where to click to get what you want and often the people around you know it too.  
In the enterprise world, we are so used to Windows, Office, Photoshop for example that you may not think about using something else instead.

If you build your stack around open-source software, you will have to learn how to use Linux instead of Windows for example, LibreOffice instead of Office, etc...  

But let's be honest it is today much easier than a few years ago for two reasons: open-source software doesn't necessarly mean a poor user experience anymore and we are already used to learning new tools everyday: we use phones with Android/iOS or Mac instead of Windows for example.  

The second, and more positive impact, is the cost.  
Most startups like to work with Macbooks and it costs between 1200€ and 2000€.  
But today, computer technology is mature enough to not focus only on hardware.  
For example I work with a three years old laptop that cost me 600€ and it completely fits my needs.  

The real question is: do I need a Macbook, knowing that today's latest laptops are way more powerful than a Macbook Pro, to do my job ?  
I use my computer to code, run programs, do data analysis or image editing and it does its job perfectly; I guess you and almost all your colleagues don't need your computer to do more than that.  
And on top I can always use the latest software version without having to renew costly licences every year.  

Imagine you are a team of five: each of you has a Windows laptop and a full version of Microsoft Office. You can at least save 150-200€ per license and 10€ per user per month if you decide to fully migrate to open-source. And I don't even consider the cost of buying cheaper computers.  
That means over 2500€ in savings over the next three years. And even more if you consider the software renewal in three years.  
Of course there is a hidden change management cost, but would it be reasonable to assume that it would be higher than 150€ per person per year ? Maybe for some people, but usually these people would have needed a high support with Windows also anyway.  

You could always consider to migrate only your operating system to a linux distribution but keeping Office 365 online or Google Docs as a document suite.  

And we are just talking about the tip of the Iceberg in terms of cost reduction. Imagine you then migrate your project management software, your CRM or your ERP from proprietary software to open-source software!  

This is were it starts to become interesting: you can build yourself a fully operational and optimized software stack that really answers your business requirements without being locked-in with vendors contracts and proprietary standards.  
Even more, it gives small and medium business access to powerful software for a fraction of the spendings of big firms.  

The full power of open-source is that it allows you to choose the tools you really need without the full cost of a proprietary software, to benefit from improvements from a community, to always use the latest version without additional cost.  

It doesn't mean that you won't face the same issues as any software implementation project but at least it gives you flexibility and additional control.  

We will explore these benefits in the next articles and build a basic stack together.
