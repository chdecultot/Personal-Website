#### The value of an open-source ERP
</br>

  It is a common idea spread amongst entrepreneurs or SME managers: The image of an ERP is often strongly linked with very complex, non-intuitive and non-user-friendly software like SAP or Oracle.  
</br>

With the emergence of [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service) services, this image is not true anymore. You can easily suscribe to any service you need for your business for a few euros per month.  
These services are most of the time very user friendly, provide the most useful functionalities and can often interact with every other software in your stack.  
</br>

But when you start adding up the cost of each of the services you need to run a company (CRM, billing, purchasing, accounting, inventory, point-of-sales, HR, ...), the bill is soon very high.  
</br>

On the other hand most ERP are priced for big companies only, with huge deployment and licence costs.  
Cloud-based solutions can also be very expensive, even for medium-sized companies, and represent a huge risk for any company considering changing its business solutions.  
</br>

This is the main advantage of open-source solutions: you are not tied up to a single vendor and you don't have to pay any licence, which allows you to test it before embracing it.  

The only hidden cost is the time you are willing to invest in using a solution to see if it fits your need.  
</br>

Therefore there are no entry barriers for small-sized companies and highly reduced transformation costs for bigger ones.  

### How do I choose the right ERP ?

If you decide to choose an open-source ERP solution, the first move would be to test the different existing solutions.  

In the open-source world, the choice narrows down mainly to ERPNext and Odoo.  
</br>

Whereas Odoo can be considered as a great choice, ERPNext is the only truely open-source ERP with a GPLv3 licence (MIT licence for the underlying Frappe framework).  
</br>

Anyway, I recommend you to test both by creating a free cloud-based account for [ERPNext](https://erpnext.com/pricing) or [Odoo](https://www.odoo.com/pricing) to test the software and see if it corresponds to most of your actual business processes.  
You can also start with a low-cost hosting solution with [DOKOS](https://www.dokos.io/pricing/). You won't have to deal with another migration or start over if you want to customize the software at a later point in time.  
</br>

This phase will allow you to find gaps between the standard business practices proposed by the software and your own business processes.  
</br>

While usually this "fit-gap analysis" happens before the implementation of an ERP, with the open-source solutions you are able to redefine you usage based on the your actual practice.  

You will be able to find out that you only need small customization like invoice layouts or changing the logic of a particular module, or need to create a completely new module for a missing functionality.  
</br>

This is one of the great advantages of ERPNext. Its architecture allows the creation of external modules without limiting the possibility to upgrade the core solution.  
</br>

Let's say you need a specific module for agricultural parcells management. You can build it internally or have an external provider build it for you as an additionnal application.  
When you need to upgrade ERPNext, this customization won't limit your possibilities, you will just have to make sure it follows Frappe guidelines to be also upgraded independently.  
</br>

This in-depth analysis of your needs will allow you to gain a lot of time and avoid spending high amounts in incomplete up-front analysis.  
</br>

Additionnally, whether it is ERPNext of Odoo, both software can be easily connected to most software on the market, allowing you, for example, to get paid via Paypal or manage your Shopify e-commerce website automatically.  
</br>

#### An alternative method

As you can see, choosing an open-source ERP allows you to choose exactly what you need, but it can seem quite complex if you have few or no technical knowledge.  
</br>

This is where being supported by a external team of experts during the process can be very valuable.  
The implementation of an open-source ERP shouldn't be seen as fondamentally different from a classic proprietary implementation. It is just more flexible because you have no vendor lock-in.  
</br>

The different stages of implementation should therefore be:

1. Test ERPNext or Odoo either via a free-tier offer or via an hosted solution.
2. Identify your business processes and the gaps existing with the software.
3. Launch small customization projects to solve critical issues that can be handled by the core functionalities of the software.
4. Integrate your ERP with external, more specialized, applications.
5. Launch major customization projects involving the creation of additional applications.

With these stages, you don't have to rely entirely on an external team of consultant to assess your needs and can instead be entirely part of the process, which is key to any application deployment.  

You only need to choose your consultants team wisely.
